National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF1)


 
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was approved by the MHRD and launched by Honorable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015.
This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters Considered are as follows:
Teaching, Learning &amp; Resources

Student Strength including Doctoral Students
Faculty-student ratio with emphasis on permanent faculty (FSR)
Combined metric for Faculty with PhD (or equivalent) and Experience (FQE)
Total Budget and Its Utilisation: (CBTU)

Research and Professional Practice

Combined metric for Publications (PU)
Combined metric for Quality of Publications (QP)
IPR and Patents: Filed, Published, Granted and Licensed (IPR)
Footprint of Projects and Professional Practice And Executive Development Programs (FPPP):

Graduation Outcomes

Combined % for Placement, Higher Studies, and Entrepreneurship (GPHE)
Metric for University Examinations: GUE
Median Salary
Metric for Graduating Students Admitted Into Top Universities (GTOP)
Metric for Number of Ph.D. Students Graduated GPHD

Outreach and Inclusivity

Percent Students from other states/countries (Region Diversity RD)
Percentage of Women (WF) + (WS) + (WA)
Economically and Socially Challenged Students (ESCS)
Facilities for Physically Challenged Students (PCS)

Perception

Peer Perception: Employers and Research Investors (PREMP)
Peer Perception: Academics (PRACD)
Public Perception (PRPUB)
Competitiveness (PRCMP)
